Fyte is a JVM bytecode assembler written in Pez, a 90s era Forth
currently being rehabilitated.

You can git Pez at git://github.com/pete/pez.git

Building Pez should be stupid simple.  
Pester Pete if it's not, 'cause I voted for CMake.

At the moment, Pez doesn't support loadpaths or any such fineries,
so you have to cd into fyte/lib to run anything.  No, nothing here is
much worth running yet.

First milestone is a dictionary of Forth words that write valid classfiles.
Second milestone will be a DSL that resembles assembly language
Third milestone will involve some sort of higher level DSL usable for compiling to bytecode.
